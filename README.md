# Custom Dual OD - Chris Mang

Custom dual drive in a 1590BB featuring a Zendrive on one side, and a modified bluesbreaker on the other.

## v1.0.0-build
1590BB encl. Works with `1590BB-2` of the [Dual Effect Order Switching Board](https://github.com/markbennett95/dual-effect-order-switching-board). Zendrive schematic is unchanged, using the "version" switch and a DG412. The Bluesbreaker is a pretty straight up clone with added clean blend.
